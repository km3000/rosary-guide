This is a simple guide to praying the Rosary, written in Java. It is currently still a work in progress

## Build Instructions
This program was made using Eclipse IDE, so it should be fairly simple to compile from there. It also requires the [Apache Commons Lang3 package](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-release/index.html). After creating your JAR file, make sure that the "pics" and "prayers" folders and the icon files are included with it as they would be before compilation with the source files. See the [releases](https://github.com/km3000/rosary-guide/releases) for an idea of how to package the built program.

## Licensing
This program is licensed under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more details. See the text files included in the ["pics" folder](https://github.com/km3000/rosary-guide/tree/master/pics) for more information about the [origins and licensing](https://github.com/km3000/rosary-guide/blob/master/pics/licensing.md) of the included pictures.
